# Privacy Policy for URL Collector & Sharer

**Last updated:** December 20, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. It is URL Collector & Sharer's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our browser extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so—specifically, to provide our services to you using the extension's features.

### Usage Data (Locally Stored)
When you use the extension, we store the following data **locally on your device** within the Chrome browser's storage system:
*   **URLs:** The web addresses of pages you explicitly collect or visit (if Auto-Collection is enabled).
*   **Page Titles:** The titles of the web pages associated with the collected URLs.
*   **Timestamps:** The time at which the URL was collected.
*   **Settings:** Your preferences for the extension (e.g., floating button position, auto-collection status).

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the information strictly to provide the core functionality of the extension:
*    To create your temporary list of collected links.
*   To allow you to export this list to a file (JSON, CSV, TXT).
*   To restore your session if you choose to import a file.
*   To display favicons (icons) for the websites you visit.

**We do NOT transmit this data to any external servers.** All processing happens locally on your computer.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

*   **Local Storage:** All collected URLs and settings are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
*   **Transient Nature:** By design, the collected URL list is **session-based**. The extension is programmed to clear the list automatically when you restart your browser, ensuring your data does not persist longer than needed.
*   **User Control:** You have full control to manually delete individual items or clear the entire list at any time via the extension interface.

## 4. Sharing of Information

**We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information or collected data to others.** We do not use third-party analytics services that track your browsing activity.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The extension may fetch favicons (website icons) to display in the user interface. This is done using standard Google services (e.g., `www.google.com/s2/favicons`) or by reading the page metadata. No personal browsing history is shared with these services beyond the domain name required to fetch the icon.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page or our GitHub repository.
